[SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com/).

Essentially duplicates the functionality of
[Airfoil Remote](https://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/remote/) in a way that you
can integrate with the rest of your home automation.

## Crazy things you could do with this

* Build integrated audio
* Control Airfoil speaker volume with a Z-Wave dimmer
* Turn on and off Airfoil speakers
  [with HomeKit and Siri](http://community.smartthings.com/t/hello-home-homekit-and-siri-control-via-homebridge/16701)
